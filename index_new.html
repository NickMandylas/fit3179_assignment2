        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          Health is a key property for creating a good quality of life. Being
          able to be free from illness or injury can directly affect our
          capacity to enjoy life.

        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          Utilising data from the 2020 report of the World Heatlh Statistics

          drinking water, clean household energy, tobacco control or the
          availabity of medical doctors, can affect health in a country.

        <h2>Life Expectancy & HALE</h2>
        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          Life expectancy is the most commonly used measure used to describe a
          populationâ€™s health. Historical data shows that global life expectancy
          has increased drastically over the last couple of centuries, with
          substantial long-run improvements in all countries around the world.
          In fact, recent life expectancy gains in developing countries have
          been particularly important. However, despite recent progress towards
          long-run cross-country convergence, there are still huge differences
          that have to be addressed: in several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
          the average life expectancy is still less than 60 years, compared to
          more than 80 years in countries in Europe or in Japan.
        </p>
        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          As the world's population is living longer, it is important to
          understand whether people are spending more years in good health or
          more years living with illness. The measure of health-adjusted life
          expectancy (HALE) can be used to understand this.
        </p>
        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          <b>HALE</b> extends the concept of life expectancy by considering the
          time spent living with disease and injury. It reflects the length of
          time an individual at a specific age can, on average, expect to live
          in full health; that is, time lived without the health consequences of
          disease or injury.

        <p style="opacity: 80%; margin-top: 10px">
          Below is a comparison of HALE between all the regions. Here we can
          notice that Africa by far has the lowest HALE, closely followed by the
          Middle East. The Western World being Europe and Western Pacific are
          regions in the world with the highest average HALE.

        <h2>Medical Professionals</h2>
        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          Here we'll explore how medical professionals (doctors, dentists,
          midwives and pharamcists) have an effect on healthcare in each
          country.

        <p class="text-light" style="opacity: 80%">
          In this section, we'll explore how mental health is a problem compared
          to each country. Interestingly from the map below, we can see that
          Western Countries (unlike the first choropleth map) have higher
          sucicide rates compared to African/Asian countries. This could
          possibly mean that good health/healthcare doesn't necessary mean good
          mental health.

        <h2>Healthcare Spending</h2>
        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          Now we'll explore how healthcare is spent between countries, below are
          two graphs showing the top 10 and bottom 10 countries by healthcare
          expenditure per capita. You'll notice that all the bottom 10 countries
          are African, whilst all the top 10 are western countries.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          It's interesting to note that these African countries only have
          $18-$30 per capita to spend on it's population, whilst having
          substantially larger populations compared to highest spending western
          countries. Countries such as Switzerland are spending 500 times more,
          but have at least 10-15 times smaller population size.

          id="received_expenditure_by_country"

        <p style="opacity: 80%">
          Finally we'll look at the top countries who have the largest
          healthcare spend received internationally. Interestingly, this does
          not include the countries listed above, that have substantially larger
          populations, but less money.
